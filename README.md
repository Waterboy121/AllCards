# AllCards

AllCards is a web application that brings trading card collecting into the digital era. It lets users create a searchable, personal digital binder where they can store, browse, and organize cards from various franchises such as PokÃ©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic: The Gathering, and more.

---

## Project Vision

To create the most intuitive and personalized digital binder experience for collectors and fans of trading card games â€” a place to truly own, explore, and organize their card collections the way they want.

---

## The Problem

- Physical binders are limited and not easily shareable
- Online databases often lack personalization
- Users often spread their collections across multiple platforms
- No tool combines visual collection browsing with tagging, searching, and favorites

AllCards solves this by offering a central, personalized, visually rich digital binder that works across all franchises.

---

## Target Audience

- Casual and hardcore TCG collectors
- Competitive players building and managing decks
- Newcomers to trading card games
- Collectors of specific or multiple franchises

Whether you collect PokÃ©mon, One Piece, Yu-Gi-Oh, or Magic, AllCards gives you one place to manage it all.
