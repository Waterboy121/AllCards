# AllCards

AllCards is a web application designed to modernize the trading card collecting experience. It provides users with a searchable, customizable digital binder where they can store, browse, and organize cards from multiple franchises. Supported games include PokÃ©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, and more, all presented in one visually unified platform.

---

## Project Vision

To build the most intuitive, flexible, and franchise-spanning digital binder for trading card collectors. This is a space where users can truly own, explore, and manage their collections with powerful tools and a personalized experience at the core.

## Supported Franchises

### The Big Three

### The Newcomers

## The Problem

- Physical binders are limited and not easily shareable
- Online databases often lack personalization
- Users often spread their collections across multiple platforms

## Target Audience

- Casual and hardcore TCG collectors
- Competitive players building and managing decks
